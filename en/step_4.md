Add two more circles behind the snake to make its full body.

<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Slither, slither...</h2>

Let’s give your snake a longer body by adding two more segments behind it.

We’ll keep using the `x` variable and subtract different amounts to place each circle in the right spot.

Each one should be a little smaller, and moved further to the left.

def draw():
    global x
    background('lightblue')
    fill('green')
    circle(x, 200, 50)        # head at x
    circle(x - 35, 200, 40)   # body 1
    circle(x - 65, 200, 35)   # body 2
    circle(x - 95, 200, 30)   # tail

    x += 2  # increase x by 2

### Tip

- Try changing the sizes of the circles to make a chunky or skinny snake.<br />
- You can also change how far apart the segments are.

### Debugging

If some parts of the body don’t show up:<br />
- Check each `circle()` has 3 numbers<br />
- Look out for spelling errors or missing commas<br />
- Remember: every new segment is further left (use `x - ...`)
