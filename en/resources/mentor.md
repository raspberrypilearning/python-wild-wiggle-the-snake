# Mentor Notes: Wiggly Snake

## Project Overview

In this Python Wild project, learners use the p5 library to build and animate a wiggly cartoon snake. They start by drawing shapes, then bring the snake to life using animation based on variables and sine waves.

---

## What Learners Will Practise

- Drawing with `circle()`
- Using variables for animation
- Coordinating movement with `x` and `offset`
- Layering and positioning shapes
- Customising with colour and expression

---

## Teaching Tips

- Highlight that `draw()` repeats automatically, like a flipbook
- Keep explanations of `sin()` simple â€” focus on the effect, not the math
- Let learners experiment with speed, size, and colour freely

## Extension Ideas

- Add a tongue or crown
- Animate other creatures (e.g. caterpillar or dragon)
- Add a background or sound effects
